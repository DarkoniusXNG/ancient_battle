# Ancient Battle Dota 2 custom game
Goal of this custom game is to:
* create new heroes
* create new items
* recreate dota removed heroes (Gambler, Astral Trekker, Void Demon, old Silencer, old Lifestealer etc.)
* recreate some old heroes
* recreate some old items
* create new game mechanics
* change some dota conventions.

This custom game contains custom heroes and custom items.
This custom game has 5 maps: main, 2v2, 3v3, 5v5, and holdout

main map supports up to 8 players. This map contains:
* 2 lanes, 
* 2 bases with towers, barracks and the Ancient.
* vanilla Roshan
* vanilla creep camps
Win condition is 45 kills or destroying the Ancient.

2v2 map is intended for:
* solo testing custom heroes and custom items (like hero demo mode)
* for 1v1 or 2v2 duels.
This map contains:
* 1 lane
* 2 bases with 1 tower and fountain
* custom creep camps.
Win condition is 20 kills or destroying the Tower.

3v3 map is the same as the main map, except it's snow in some places. Intended as backup map for the main map.
Not playable.

5v5 map is similar to dota's normal map (from patch 6.83) but has a different jungle, different Roshan spot etc.
Win condition is the same as in normal dota. So the goal is to destroy the enemy Ancient.
Custom Roshan is WIP.
Minimap is still bugged.

holdout map is an experimental holdout mode for max 4 players.
Everything on this map is WIP.
Currently there is no win condition.
