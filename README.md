# Ancient Battle Dota 2 custom game
Goal of this custom game is to:
* create new heroes
* recreate dota removed heroes (Gambler, Astral Trekker, Void Demon, old Silencer, old Lifestealer etc.)
* recreate some old heroes 
* create new game mechanics
* change some dota conventions.

This custom game contains custom heroes and custom items.
This custom game has 3 maps: 2v2, 5v5, and holdout

2v2 map is intended for:
* solo testing custom heroes and custom items (like hero demo mode)
* for 1v1 or 2v2 duels. Win condition is 10 kills.
Jungle camps are WIP.

5v5 map is similar to dota's normal map but has a different jungle, different Roshan spot etc.
Win condition is the same as in normal dota. So the goal is to destroy the enemy Ancient.
Custom Roshan is WIP.
Minimap is bugged.

holdout map is an experimental holdout mode for max 4 players.
Everything on this map is WIP.
Currently there is no win condition.
