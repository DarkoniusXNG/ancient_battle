1) Run generate_tooltips.bat to merge text files in folder tooltips_english and create tooltips_english.txt in resource folder.
2) generate_tooltips.bat will work only in that way only if he is inside that folder (tooltips_english)
Maybe I will change how this works in the future.
3) generate_tooltips.bat will merge .txt files in alphabetical order. That's why there are .txt files with names 0000000 and zzzzzzzz.
Those files include addon_english.txt unique Keyvalues and brackets.
4) All tooltip .txt files need to have the same encoding: UCS-2 LE BOM
